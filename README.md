# CPG-325-individual-assignment-2025

**Overview**

This repository contains all configurations, documentation, and simulation files for the CMPG 325 Individual Computer Networks Project. The project demonstrates the design, simulation, and configuration of various network topologies using Cisco Packet Tracer, as well as individual network feature configuration through subnetting and network services.

Part I – Network Topologies Design & Simulation (50%)
Topologies Designed

Bus Topology

Mesh Topology

Star Topology

Ring Topology

Extended Star Topology

Each topology was simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer and verified for successful data communication between devices.

Hybrid Topology

A hybrid topology integrating features of multiple network types was designed.
It includes:

IPv4 and IPv6 configurations

VLAN segmentation

At least one functional server (HTTP, DNS, or DHCP)

Basic network security measures (passwords, access restrictions, etc.)

Part II – Individual Network Feature Configuration (20%)
Subnetting

The network was divided into subnets to optimize IP address usage and improve management.

Each subnet supports a specific department or VLAN group.

Configurations Applied

Static and dynamic routing

Inter-VLAN routing

DHCP relay and IP helper configuration

Security enhancements (enable passwords, SSH access
